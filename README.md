🏦 Bank Management System

The Bank Management System is a simple command-line Python application designed to simulate basic banking operations. It provides secure login authentication, allowing users to perform essential financial transactions such as deposits, withdrawals, balance inquiries, and transaction history tracking.

The system includes password protection with limited login attempts to enhance security. It maintains transaction records during the session and ensures proper validation for operations like insufficient balance and invalid inputs.

This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts including functions, conditional logic, loops, input validation, and list-based transaction management. It is ideal for beginners learning how to build structured, menu-driven applications in Python.
